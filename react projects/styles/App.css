/* This file is primarily for importing Tailwind CSS.
  If you have a `tailwind.config.js` set up correctly,
  Tailwind will generate all its utility classes based on your usage.
  
  You might only need this if you're using a PostCSS setup or 
  if you want to include some base styles that aren't easily
  covered by Tailwind utilities.

  For a basic Create React App with Tailwind, you'd typically
  install Tailwind and then configure your `tailwind.config.js`
  to scan your `src` folder for classes.

  Example content for a minimal App.css to include Tailwind:
*/

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

/*
  Optional: Add any global custom styles here if needed,
  but prefer Tailwind utility classes for most styling.
*/
body {
  font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif; /* Using Inter font as per instructions */
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
}

/* If you want to ensure the root element takes full height for min-h-screen to work
*/
#root {
  min-height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center; /* Center content vertically if it's not too tall */
